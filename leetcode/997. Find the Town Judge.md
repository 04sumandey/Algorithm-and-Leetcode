## 997. Find the Town Judge

### Question
In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:
* The town judge trusts nobody.
* Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
* There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

```
Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1

Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
```
 
Note:

1. 1 <= N <= 1000
2. trust.length <= 10000
3. trust[i] are all different
4. trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
5. 1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

### Solution
* Method 1: Indegree and outdegree of each vertex.
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
			int[] indegree = new int[N + 1];
			int[] outdegree = new int[N + 1];
			for(int[] t : trust){
				indegree[t[1]]++;
				outdegree[t[0]]++;
			}
			int res = -1;
			for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
				if(indegree[i] == N - 1 && outdegree[i] == 0){
					if(res != -1) return -1;
					else res = i;
				}
			}
			return res;
		}
	}
	```
