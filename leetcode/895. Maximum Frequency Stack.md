## 895. Maximum Frequency Stack

### Question
Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

* push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
* pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
	* If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

```
Example 1:

Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
```
 

Note:
1. Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
2. It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
3. The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
4. The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
5. The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.

### Solution
* Method 1: Map + Deque
	* We have one map saving the value and frequency.
	* We have another map, key is appearance freqency and value is a deque.
	* We always maintain the max appearance number.
	* We can take the value out of the stack in the entry and update the maxCount. Meanwhile we update the value and frequency map.
	```Java
	class FreqStack {
		private int maxCount;
		private Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;  // k: val, v: freq
		private Map<Integer, Deque<Integer>> countMap;  // k: freq, v: Stack of values that appears k key times.
		public FreqStack() {
			this.freqMap = new HashMap<>();
			this.countMap = new HashMap<>();
		}
		
		public void push(int x) {
			freqMap.put(x, freqMap.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
			int freq = freqMap.get(x);
			maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, freq);
			Deque<Integer> stack = countMap.getOrDefault(freq, new ArrayDeque<>());
			stack.push(x);
			countMap.put(freq, stack);
		}
		
		public int pop() {
			int val = countMap.get(maxCount).pop();
			freqMap.put(val, freqMap.get(val) - 1);
			if(countMap.get(maxCount).size() == 0){
				countMap.remove(maxCount);
				maxCount--;
			}
			while(!countMap.containsKey(maxCount) && maxCount > 0){
				maxCount--;
			}
			return val;
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
	 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
	 * obj.push(x);
	 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
	 */
	```

### Amazon Session
* Method 1: two maps + deque
	* Fix some bugs in first try, since all frequencies are countinuous, we don't have to use while loop to find next maxCount.
	```Java
	class FreqStack {
		private int maxCount;
		private Map<Integer, Integer> countMap;
		private Map<Integer, Deque<Integer>> freqMap;
		public FreqStack() {
			this.countMap = new HashMap<>();
			this.freqMap = new HashMap<>();
		}
		
		public void push(int x) {
			countMap.put(x, countMap.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
			int freq = countMap.get(x);
			maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, freq);
			Deque<Integer> deque = freqMap.getOrDefault(freq, new ArrayDeque<>());
			deque.push(x);
			freqMap.put(freq, deque);
		}
		
		public int pop() {
			int res = freqMap.get(maxCount).pop();
			countMap.put(res, countMap.get(res) - 1);
			if(freqMap.get(maxCount).size() == 0){
				freqMap.remove(maxCount);
				maxCount--;
			}
			return res;
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
	 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
	 * obj.push(x);
	 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
	 */
	```
