## 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

### Question
There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.

```
Example 1:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Example 3:

Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
```
 
Note:
1. 1 <= stones.length <= 30
2. 2 <= K <= 30
3. 1 <= stones[i] <= 100

### Thinking:
* Method: dp
    ```Java
   class Solution {
        public int mergeStones(int[] stones, int K) {
            int n = stones.length;
            if((n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0) return -1;
            int[][][] dp = new int[n][n][K + 1];
            int[] sum = new int[n + 1];
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
                sum[i + 1] = sum[i] + stones[i];
            for(int[][] dd: dp)
                for(int[] d: dd)
                    Arrays.fill(d, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                dp[i][i][1] = 0;
            for(int l = 2; l <= n; l++){
                for(int start = 0; start <= n - l; start++){
                    int end = start + l - 1;
                    for(int k = 2; k <= K; k++){
                        for(int mid = start; mid < end; mid += K - 1)
                            dp[start][end][k] = Math.min(dp[start][end][k], dp[start][mid][1] + dp[mid + 1][end][k - 1]);
                        dp[start][end][1] = dp[start][end][K] + sum[end + 1] - sum[start];
                    }
                }
            }
            return dp[0][n - 1][1];
        }
    }
    ```
