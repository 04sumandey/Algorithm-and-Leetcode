## 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

### Question
Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

```
Example 1:

Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

Note:
1. 0 < prices.length <= 50000.
2. 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
3. 0 <= fee < 50000.

### Solutions
* Method 1: dp
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
			if(prices == null || prices.length <= 1) return 0;
			int len = prices.length;
			int[] buys = new int[len + 1];
			int[] sells = new int[len + 1];
			buys[1] = -prices[0];
			for(int i = 2; i <= len; i++){
				buys[i] = Math.max(buys[i - 1], sells[i - 1] - prices[i - 1]);
				sells[i] = Math.max(sells[i - 1], buys[i - 1] + prices[i - 1] - fee);
			}
			return sells[len];
		}
	}
